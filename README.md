# UFO Sightings-- Fact or Fantasy?
## Overview
### Purpose

## Results
### Explantion
Initially the table may look intimidating to first time users with a plethora of excess information as can be seen in the snapshot of the initial webpage, prior to including search criteria in the search bars to the far left of the screen.

However, as one continues to narrow down their search with different criteria such as Date, City, State, Country, and Shape the table will be refined growing smaller only to show instances that correlate to said information entered. All the user has to do is simply press enter or click off the search bar for the results to be filtered. In this case I chose the date 1/5/2010 which took my initial table and filtered it down to just seven occurrences.

Again, this search is further refined when I add New Jersey as our desired state, leaving me with just two final results to peruse through.

## Summary
### Drawbacks

### Recommendations
If the webpage were to be further refined I think it would be interesting for useres if an image was included in their search results. Obviously, not everyone has time to whip out their phone when they believe they're witnessing a UFO sighting but for the ones that do it would be beneficial to users to also see that image along with the information of the sighting.
