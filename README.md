Initially the table may look intimidating to first time users with a plethora of excess information as can be seen in the snapshot of the initial webpage, prior to including search criteria in the search bars to the far left of the screen.

However, as one continues to narrow down their search with different criteria such as Date, City, State, Country, and Shape the table will be refined growing smaller only to show instances that correlate to said information entered. In this case I chose the date 1/5/2010 which took my initial table and filtered it down to just seven occurrences.

Again, this search is further refined when I add New Jersey as our desired state, leaving me with just two final results to peruse through.
